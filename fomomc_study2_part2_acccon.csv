Title of research study: Online Norm Considerations

Key information: This consent form asks you to take part in a research study. The study is being conducted by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, PhD., associate professor at Duke University in the Department of Philosophy, the Kenan Institute for Ethics, and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences. 

Purpose: This research study seeks to help us understand human behavior and judgment of social situations.

What you will be asked to do: For this second session, you will be asked to complete several demographic and personality survey items. Additionally, you will be asked to give judgments for several scenarios. The session should take less than 15 minutes. Participation in this study is voluntary, and you can stop at any time. To stop, close your browser window.

How your confidentiality will be maintained: If you choose to participate, your name will not be linked to your responses at any time, and there is no link between this consent form and your responses. All data will be securely saved at all times. 


Future use of data: Your de-identified data (data without your name or any other identifying information), together with de-identified data from other participants in the experiment, might be made publicly available and will be shared with other researchers as a requirement of publication and funding. We may also use de-identified data for future research purposes unrelated to this project.

Benefits and risks: This research will not benefit you personally. The researcher will be happy to discuss the details of the study with you in detail at its completion. We know of no risks to you for participating in this study, however, if reading anything makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to end the study at any time. 

Compensation: You will be paid $3 for fully participating (completing all tasks and passing attention checks) in the first session, and $5 for fully participating in the second session.  

Contact: If you have any questions about this research, please email the experimenter who posted the request. You may also contact the MAD Lab at paul.mckee@duke.edu if you have any questions. You may also contact the Duke IRB office with questions or concerns with your rights as a research participant at campusirb@duke.edu. Please refer to protocol #2022-0428.
